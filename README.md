> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computing that develops systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes learning, reasoning, perception, pattern recognition, and decision-making. It uses mathematical models to analyze data and learn from it. The existing models are:

* Machine Learning (ML) = Models that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform these tasks.
* Neural Networks (NM) = Models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain.
* Deep Learning (DL) = Models that use Neural Networks with multiple layers.
* Generative AI = The intelligence, capable of creating new content, such as text, images, music and even videos, based on patterns learned from existing data.
